# Randomly Generated Snake

This repository depicts a randomly generated 3D Blob with random number of body parts and random number of sensors placed randomly. The links with the sensors are colored green and the rest are colored blue

## The major features:
 - We have the number of generations that control the number of bodies generating bodies connected to them. (Constants.py)
 - Each cube that is not a last generation, picks a phase(cubeSide.py) randomly and genarates a child on that phase and that is done recursively(CreatureBody.py)
 - The body is autogenerated and with a random number of links and random number of sensors placed in random positions
 - The ant uses a paralel hill climbing evolution algorithm to build the best version

 ## Fork and Set up Guide
 - Fork and download the code from the createre branch. Any version of python `above 3.5` must be present in your system. After replication, using the terminal, navigate to the project folder and run the program using ```python3 search.py```. To modify the config file, navigate to the constants folder and 
 try modify the ```numberOfGenerations```  and or ```populationSize``` to test different levels of finetuning and the
 - To get the exact output, use the deafult seed value of random that I set as a default argument to the creature file otherwise you can modify the seed value to get other random productions
 
 
 ## Future works
  -  Exploring different evolution algorithms to make the snake crawl faster
