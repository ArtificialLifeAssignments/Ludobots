# Randomly Generated Snake

This repository depicts a randomly generated snake with random number of body parts and random number of sensors placed randomly. The links with the sensors are colored green and the rest are colored blue

## The major features:
 - The body is autogenerated and with a random number of links and random number of sensors placed in random positions
 - The ant uses a paralel hill climbing evolution algorithm to build the best version

 ## Fork and Set up Guide
 - Fork and download the code from the createre branch. Any version of python `above 3.5` must be present in your system. After replication, using the terminal, navigate to the project folder and run the program using ```python3 search.py```. To modify the config file, navigate to the constants folder and 
 try modify the ```numberOfGenerations```  and or ```populationSize``` to test different levels of finetuning and the
 - To get the exact output, use the deafult seed value of random that I set as a default argument to the creature file otherwise you can modify the seed value to get other random productions
 
 
 ## Future works
  -  Exploring different evolution algorithms to make the snake crawl faster
